[Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) 
seems like something interesting to be explored when I have time.
Basically it's core idea is to have python notebook stored in google drive,
thus can be shared more easily.

However, not too sure if it supports simultaneous edit from multiple users.
Does it make sense though? considering the users could execute something and mess up the state of the kernel.
But could still be useful to have say only 1 executor at a time but multiple editors
(even better if they can have isolated dependent kernels to execute some codes etc).
