Just discovered an interesting feature of git: rebase. So this basically lets you changes the order of commits, commit messages,
*merge*/squash commit into previous one, drop commit and so on.

I believe having a proper git GUI client won't be a bad idea.
For that i recommend [Fork](https://alternativeto.net/software/fork/).
Though not being open-source, it is free for personal and commercial usage (as compared to git kraken)
and most importantly, it has DARK THEME!!!
It is available on all except Linux, but I guess linux folks don't need GUI? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
