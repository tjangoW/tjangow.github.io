title: Vivaldi, you cannot be serious?!
tags: browser, complain

For the past few years, I have heard from quite a number of sources about Vivaldi, a Chromium-based browser which has tons of features and customisations, suitable for power users.
I have been using firefox all these while in the vainest attempt to reduce my google footprint, and also to certain extend to support essentially the only alternative to chromium-based browser.

Recently, I wanted to have 2 distinctive browser (not just different container/profile), I finally had a good look into Vivaldi.
It is quite nice at the beginning, messing with all the setting and stuff.
The tab-stack is kinda interesting though probably not something that I will use often.
Several nice built-in features are like the Window "side-panel", Full page capture, tiling, tab cycler and customisable dark theme.
I was pretty satisfied at this point and started to install several extensions (BitWarden, Dark Reader amongst others), which is when I finally realised, keyboard shortcut for extension is not working at all!!
And the issue has persisted for several years already ([Thread on Vivaldi forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/31027/keyboard-shortcuts-not-working-with-extensions/25?lang=en-GB&page=2)) :O

Seriously Vivaldi, you promoted yourself with "keep your hands on the keyboard", and you are telling me that it is only limited to your builtin features?
are you assuming that with all your features, no one need any extension?
Argh...
Don't get me wrong, I am so frustrated because you almost become my second browser of choice but now you have this deadly bug...
Is like a straight man found the perfect girl in his eyes, had a nice date and get along quite well, and now the girl says: "I am a man" :facepalm:
