title: Changing Keymap on Windows
tags: windows

I have heard about e.g. changing `Caps Lock` to `Ctrl` (as obviously, `Caps Lock` is not used as often as initially thought).
Found a [nice article on HowToGeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/map-any-key-to-any-key-on-windows-xp-vista/) about it.
Though when you are done with it, a restart is required.
